# What - we are trying to establish a connection and read data from the database in the python console
# In real time we see the output in the graphical user interface GUI
# pyodbc - just a python library helps you connect to database
# as per the wiki pyodbc is an open source python moudle that
# why - helping us to showcase data in the console which in real time, we would display

# import correct module
# find variables with login detaails (server,databse, username, password)
# connectionstring concatenated the variables
# troubleshoot
# with loop
# try for 5 seconds


# Specifying the ODBC driver, server name, database, etc. directly

# print(cnxn)
# print(cursor)

# try:
#     with pyodbc.connect(connection, timeout=5) as connection:

for row in rows:

# if you want to get back to the start, you need a new cursor or to run the excute command again
# fetchone row-fetchone(), if fetch many rows that is fetchmany(), if fetch all rows that is fetchall()



# acquire a cursor from a connection-execute the code-through
# the cursor-cursor.fetch-iterate through the results by using the raw objects that are returned by the cursor.fetch
# Cursor is a control structure that allows to control and manage rows of data from a response. In the pyodbc instance
# it is usd to manage our queries directly with the db
